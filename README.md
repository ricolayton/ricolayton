## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a way to give accurate dates to leather, paper, and parchment
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R, and Python with Visual Script Code
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on statistical coding, but it is more like leeching
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing code and in Markdown
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about conservation of book and paper, I can give you my best lessons learned
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ricolayton@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I left my job in Hawaii to go back to studying how paper and leather degrade overtime. Some say I'm crazy, actually it is just me telling people I'm crazy.

Please send me any sort of resources you think can help me. Learn is tricky, but learning together is fun
